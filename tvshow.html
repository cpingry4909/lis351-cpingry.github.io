            <h2>Brief Synopsis</h2>
            <p class="synop"> The Netflix show follows Marty Byrd, a financial advisor from Chicago who has been laundering
            money for one of the largest Mexican drug cartels for years. His reality comes crashing
            down when it is discovered that his partner had been siphoning money from their operation. 
            In order to stay alive, Marty agrees to move his family out to the Lake of the Ozarks
            in Missouri to continue laundering money to repay what his partner stole. Marty must keep his family safe
            while also covering up their reason for moving.</p>
            <p class="reason">I began watching the show in September 2020 right as the Fall semester had started. One of my
            roommates wanted me to watch it and said he would watch it again with me, so we started it. I quickly became 
            a little bit too engrossed and we watched all 3 seasons that were out at the time really fast.  I actually
            tested positive for COVID-19 because he unknowingly had it and gave it to me, so we watched while quarantining too!
            I recently watched the first half of season 4 that just released in January.</p>

        <h2>My Favorite Aspects</h2>
        <ul class="tvpros">
            <li class="tvpros">At the beginning of each episode, an O is displayed on the screen and divided into 4 corners, 
                each containing an object or scene that viewers can find throughout as they watch</li>
            <li class="tvpros">The acting is done very well, but the character development from the start to current season for some of them is 
                amazing as you learn more about the story</li>
            <li class="tvpros">My favorite character is Buddy, an old man that agrees to rent his house out to the Byrd family when they
                move to Missouri</li>
        </ul>
        <dl class="tvrate">
            <dt class="tvrate">My Rating: 4.8/5</dt>
                <dd class="tvrate">The show combines some very interesting lifestyles and brings together the modern business city-life with the
                    rugged callused down-and-dirty in the form of a thrilling drama. You are kept on your toes all throughout as events play 
                    out quickly and take unlikely turns often.  This being said, at moments I do feel like some of the acting can be a bit almost
                    over-the-top, particularly Wendy (Marty's wife). Despite this the story is moving in a great direction currenly and I recommend
                    watching if you have not.
