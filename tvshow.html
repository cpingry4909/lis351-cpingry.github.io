        <h3>My Favorite Aspects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>At the beginning of each episode, an O is displayed on the screen and divided into 4 corners, 
                each containing an object or scene.  Viewers can find each of these things throughout the episodeas they watch.</li>
            <li>The acting is done very well, but the character development from the start to current season for some of them is 
                amazing as you learn more about the story.</li>
