            <dt>Video Games</dt>
            <dd>I play many different types of games with my friends using a trusty
                 game laptop I got for graduating high school. My favorite games include
                 <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>
                 (this game is so cool, link included), Valorant, most Legend of Zelda titles, 
                 and Destiny 2.
            </dd>
            <dt>Physical Activity</dt>
            <dd>I enjoy most forms of physical activity and my habits have changed over the 
                 years.  Up through high school I played sports such as tennis, track/running,
                baseball, and even lacrosse for a bit.  Now I typically go to the gym around 5 days 
                per week with friends or my roommates.</dd>
            <dt>Traveling</dt>
            <dd>This is more of a passion than a hobby, but I really enjoy travel and seeing new
                new places when I am given the opportunity. Living among new cultures is probably one 
                of the most exciting parts of life for me. I have been to Mexico, Canada, Europe, and South
                Korea and hope to expand the list soon.
