        <h2>Trip Description and my Experience</h2>
        <p>My family took a trip to Europe in the spring of 2012 when I was in 6th grade. 
             We spent about 7-9 days between England and Paris and it was a great time. I was young
             but the different cultures were so unique and seeing some of the world's most famous
             monuments, art, and architecture is something I will remember forever.  This trip was
             most likely the one that really created my passion for traveling and experiencing
             new cultures.  Although I have been limited in my ability to fly expecially with the 
             COVID-19 pandemic, there are still many places I want to see in the next few years.

        <h3>The Best Parts</h3>
        <p> I absolutely loved the food in Paris and every restaurant we went to was amazing.  The 
            people-watching was another great part for me especially in the quieter parts. I am so glad 
            that I was able to see Notre Dame before the fire, I feel very lucky. The art in the Louvre
            is an experience I can still picture in my head.</p>

        <h4>The Bad Parts</h4>
        <p> I loved this trip and everything about it, but I think I was still too young at the 
            time to truly appreciate it and learn. I don't remember some parts of it and I just
            believe it did not impact me as much as a trip today would. Another thing is that French
            people hate Americans so sometimes we were treated poorly because of our lack of language 
            skills, etc. Another downside for me was not seeing Mont-Saint Michel which is one of the 
            coolest places ever and I will go back to see it someday.
